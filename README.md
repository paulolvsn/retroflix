## [Our getflixProject](https://retro-flix.000webhostapp.com/)

## Mission objectives
Now is the time to take stock of everything you've learned so far and add a layer at the same time!

And what could be better for this than putting it into practice :)

## The Mission
In this exercise you must create a Streaming site in html / css, javascript and php.

Get inspired by Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and other Popcorn Time, Stremio ... The goal is to display a catalog of movies. Spot the similarities between these platforms (navbar, header, search tool, different categories of videosâ€¦) See what is cool and what works.

### Must-have features
- [x] A session system: registration, connection / disconnection.
- [x] Different rights: registrants have the right to comment on the content. You can add other rights depending on the different types of users.
- [x] Include a search bar and sort by filters
- [x] Make a secure code
- [x] Deploy the site. PHP is not supported by github, find free alternatives.

### Nice-to-have features
- [x] Management of lost passwords.
- [x] Back office for user and comment management (CRUD).
- [x] Create a page or section that displays the top movies with the movie db API.
- [x] Integrate a newsletter with Mailchimp.

### Miscellanous information
* The videos will not be hosted by you, a simple link to the Youtube trailer will suffice.

## Deliverables
* Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.
* Pimp up the readme file:
  * What, Why, When, How, Who.
* Pending things to do
* It must contain a link to the "live" version. The "live" version must contain a link to the source code on GitHub.
* Publish the link to the "live" version on Discord.

### Steps
* Get organized. Discuss, define tasks, choose a git master, a schedule, deadlines ...
* Use Trello, google agenda ... to help you.
* Define your work methodology.
* Study the request (What & Why ?)
* Identify technical challenges (How ?)
* Make models, diagrams of the database. Do all the research beforehand. Do not start coding before your project is studied from a to z.
* Give briefings / debriefings, put a lot on communication, this is the key.
* Comment out all of your code. Without comments it will be very difficult for you to work together.
* Don't just do what you can, get out of your comfort zone.
* Each member of the team must work on the whole project.

## Member system 

By following this [openclassroom course](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/918836-concevez-votre-site-web-avec-php-et-mysql/917948-tp-creez-un-espace-membres) we built a basic member system. 

Here is how look the data base :

![image-20210412135649075](images/user-db.png)

The date is generated automatically when we insert a new member in the base.

The admin field determine the user rights. If admin = 1, he's and admin and he can access to the back office to manage comment, movies, users accounts etc...

The password is hashed with the password_hash function in php.

For the avatar, a random string is added to the name to avoid duplicates.

Then the valid field indicates if the account is validated, and finally, recovery is a random string generated randomly to confirm the account creation or a password recovery.

When the user create his account a mail is sent to his mail box to confirm the registration. To do that we used [phpMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer), really easy to configure but less functionalities than MailChimp.

If the user is not connected he can't watch a movie and the play button is replaced with a "register" button. 

When he's connected he can access to his member area, change his avatar and his password.

Here is the member area:
