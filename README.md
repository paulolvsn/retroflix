## Mission objectives
Now is the time to take stock of everything you've learned so far and add a layer at the same time!

And what could be better for this than putting it into practice :)

## The Mission
In this exercise you must create a Streaming site in html / css, javascript and php.

Get inspired by Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and other Popcorn Time, Stremio ... The goal is to display a catalog of movies. Spot the similarities between these platforms (navbar, header, search tool, different categories of videosâ€¦) See what is cool and what works.

### Must-have features
- [ ] A session system: registration, connection / disconnection.
- [ ] Different rights: registrants have the right to comment on the content. You can add other rights depending on the different types of users.
- [ ] Include a search bar and sort by filters
- [ ] Make a secure code
- [ ] Deploy the site. PHP is not supported by github, find free alternatives.
 
### Nice-to-have features
- [ ] Management of lost passwords.
- [ ] Back office for user and comment management (CRUD).
- [ ] Create a page or section that displays the top movies with the movie db API.
- [ ] Integrate a newsletter with Mailchimp.

### Miscellanous information
* The videos will not be hosted by you, a simple link to the Youtube trailer will suffice.

## Deliverables
* Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.
* Pimp up the readme file:
  * What, Why, When, How, Who.
* Pending things to do
* It must contain a link to the "live" version. The "live" version must contain a link to the source code on GitHub.
* Publish the link to the "live" version on Discord.

### Steps
* Get organized. Discuss, define tasks, choose a git master, a schedule, deadlines ...
* Use Trello, google agenda ... to help you.
* Define your work methodology.
* Study the request (What & Why ?)
* Identify technical challenges (How ?)
* Make models, diagrams of the database. Do all the research beforehand. Do not start coding before your project is studied from a to z.
* Give briefings / debriefings, put a lot on communication, this is the key.
* Comment out all of your code. Without comments it will be very difficult for you to work together.
* Don't just do what you can, get out of your comfort zone.
* Each member of the team must work on the whole project.
